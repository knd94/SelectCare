Let’s get out there and make a difference. By the way, I will put up the slides with notes on what I say. This way nobody’s really missing out. If someone’s sick, or has anything important, every Monday, I will upload the slides, with the notes, onto the Microsoft Teams group. That is all. Thank you for listening. I appreciate your patience with me.
