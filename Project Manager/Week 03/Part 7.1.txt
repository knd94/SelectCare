Onto the next slide. .
Thursday’s meetings. Now, we agreed upon meeting online. I’m fine with that. Would anyone be more comfortable meeting in person though? Because what we could, theoretically do, is, if people aren’t comfortable for any reason at all just meeting online, we could have one person using a PC or laptop with the uncomfortable person, and then, if they’re okay with it, talking for them? So I’m asking, is everyone really okay with meeting online?
