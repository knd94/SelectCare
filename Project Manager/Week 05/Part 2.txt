This is Sprint Week 2. This will be easy if we keep these tasks up. Next slide please? 
So, I’d like to know how everyone’s doing in terms of the tasks. See if there’s any problems. I’d like to have private meetings if everyone’s okay with it. Today if possible. Next slide please.
I have decided that Matt and Luke are my sub team leaders. It’s nothing against anyone. They’re the first ones that I talked to I think. In the first workshop. If anyone has any problems with that, then you can bring it up now if you would like to. Or in the private meetings.
