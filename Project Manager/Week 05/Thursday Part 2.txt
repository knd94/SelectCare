About the attack on the University’s servers, don’t worry about it. It looks like we’re way ahead from what the workshop tutor said. However, please proceed with your tasks or try to as I know it has affected a lot of things that you were working on unfortunately. But it does seem like we’re having another week on the sprint. I’m not sure though. Although I do think we should because we're all using my s q l for a databases. And as well as that I heard a lot of websites people are setting up, so it'd be unfair and unjust to not give us another week I think. . .
And about the workshops, from what it looks, the tutor likes us compared to the other groups. It is actually funny. But no worries there. We shall proceed as planned. . . 
Any questions?
