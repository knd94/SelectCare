If we take last week’s group task, we’re way ahead of everyone. Like it’s not even close. We got the funnel out the first meeting, meanwhile the group task was making the funnel. And other things as well. That’s if we take the last week’s task seriously. Some groups might have had their funnels out in the same week. So, let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Let’s just work as normal, and go from there. Next slide please. .
Any questions?
