The video presentation. I know you're probably stressed about this. Don't be. If you want to go in and work on it, please do. If not, then it's okay too, just contribute your part. That said, we aren't in video editing stuff. So, that might be a problem. We just don't know yet. I think Kian said he had done video editing before. I only know windows movie maker Confidently, and that's bad. It's outdated. It's not Adobe or something newer. So, Kian, what do you want to do? Do you want us to come in and work on it with you, or just work alone and we'll give you feedback on it whenever applicable?
