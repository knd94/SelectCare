I think we're still ahead of schedule. We won't worry or stress out. There's no need for that. What I think we need to do is just keep doing what we're doing and we'll be good to go onto the m m p. also, if any of your videos are too big for repository on git hub, which they probably are, then I suggest that you upload it on one Drive or wherever you want, and put the link in a notepad file or a word document, and submit it. Any questions? I don't know what else there is to discuss.
